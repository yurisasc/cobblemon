/**
 * A registry which queues up for a [DeferredRegister] and will eventually be complete.
 * This wraps logic around checking for which registry entries still need to be registered
 * and completes the [completed] future once all entries are finished.
 *
 * When all the [CompletableRegistry] instances have completed, the [allRegistriesCompleted]
 * future will complete.
 *
 * This is a solution to deferred registries having inconsistent completion moments across
 * platforms as they lack a unified event that guarantees standard registrations are complete.
