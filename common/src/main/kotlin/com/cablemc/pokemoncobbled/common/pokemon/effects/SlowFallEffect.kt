     Long term we need to do this differently. There is a restriction in minecraft that for a StatusEffect, i.e. SLOW_FALLING,
     only one status instance can exist. If someone puts pokemon on their shoulder for slow fall and then they take the potion,
     they SHOULD have the effect even after they take their pokemon off the shoulder since the potion would still be in effect,
     but it won't have even been added because of the uniqueness constraint. Unclear how best to solve this.

             *
             * The way this effect works is that it's constantly checking if the Pokémon is where it should be. This
             * can only happen if it is this subclass so we have the pokemonId variable. We must not allow Minecraft
             * to load this back in. We can manually handle this shit, so the goal is to stop Minecraft from doing it
             * for us.

             * Putting the ID as some impossible number means that when reading from NBT statically, it doesn't find a
             * match for the effect ID, so it doesn't bother. This is what we want because if the effect needs to
             * continue (like the Pokemon is still on the shoulder) then we handle that in our login handler - no need
             * for Minecraft to get in our way.
