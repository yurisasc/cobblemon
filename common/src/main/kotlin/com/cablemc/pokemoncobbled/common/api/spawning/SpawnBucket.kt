/**
 * A spawn bucket is a simple referenceable object by spawn files. The bucket is used early in the spawn
 * process to decide which set of spawns will be used for spawning on that attempt. Weights are used to
 * make entire buckets more or less likely, and then weighted selections will occur within whichever bucket
 * was chosen.
 *
 * Spawn buckets are configured in the main config.
