/**
 * A simple implementation of [Observable] that can only emit a singular set of values. Attempts at emitting
 * a second time throws an exception. Subscribing to a completed [SingularObservable] immediately processes
 * the values that were emitted and doesn't bother subscribing as new values will not be emitted.
 *
 * This is similar in function to a [java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture].
