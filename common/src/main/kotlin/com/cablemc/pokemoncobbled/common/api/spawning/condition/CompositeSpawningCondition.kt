/**
 * A spawning condition that is composed of a list of conditions and anticonditions.
 *
 * A composite condition passes if both of the following are true:
 * - The conditions list is empty, or any of the conditions match.
 * - The anticonditions list is empty, or none of the anticonditions match.
 *
 * In other words, if the anticonditions list has five elements, then only one of those
 * needs to be true for the spawn to be canceled. Meanwhile, if there are five elements
 * in the conditions list, then all of them would need to be false for the spawn to be
 * canceled.
