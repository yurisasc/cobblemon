/**
 * A table of drops that can produce a list of [DropEntry]. You can produce a drop list from [getDrops] to
 * then handle the drops yourself, or make it select and perform the drop by running [drop].
 *
 * A drop table is defined by its [entries], and by the [amount] range which act as the default constraint around the
 * total dropped quantity. These are only defaults, as both [getDrops] and [drop] allow the range to be overwritten.
 * These amounts are based on [DropEntry.quantity]. In some cases a single entry can be worth multiple. An example of
 * this is an item drop which drops 3 of an item. While it may only be 1 entry, it is considered 3 drops.
 *
 * A drop can be guaranteed by having a [DropEntry.percentage] of 100. This will still obey the rules around how many
 * times it can be repeated and not being selected if its quantity would exceed the amount that has been chosen for
 * the drop. For example, a 5 item drop for a drop action maxed out at 3 will never be selected even if the 5 item drop
 * was marked as a guaranteed entry.
