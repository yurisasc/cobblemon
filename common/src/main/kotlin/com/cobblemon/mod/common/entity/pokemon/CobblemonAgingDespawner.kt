/**
 * The aging despawner applies strictly to mobs that can age. Its logic is relatively simple: the closer to
 * the [nearDistance] that the entity is to a player, the older the entity must be to be despawned. At
 * [nearDistance], an entity must be [maxAgeTicks] to despawn. At [farDistance], an entity must be [minAgeTicks]
 * to despawn. The required age moves gradually for all distances between near and far.
 *
 * @param nearDistance The minimum distance from a player for which an entity can be despawned. If a player is closer
 * than this, then the entity will never be despawned.
 * @param farDistance The minimum distance from a player for which an entity will be kept alive. If no player is within
 * this distance, then the entity will be immediately despawned unless they are younger than [minAgeTicks].
 * @param minAgeTicks The minimum age for an entity before it will be considered for despawning.
 * @param maxAgeTicks The maximum age an entity may be before it will be automatically despawned if it is at least [nearDistance]
 * from a player.
