     Long term we need to do this differently. There is a restriction in minecraft that for a StatusEffect, i.e. SLOW_FALLING,
     only one status instance can exist. If someone puts Pokémon on their shoulder for slow fall, and then they take the potion,
     they SHOULD have the effect even after they take their Pokémon off the shoulder since the potion would still be in effect,
     but it won't have even been added because of the uniqueness constraint. Unclear how best to solve this.
