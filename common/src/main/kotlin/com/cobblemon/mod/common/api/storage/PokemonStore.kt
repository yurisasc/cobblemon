/**
 * The base class for all stores of [Pokemon]. A store specifies the kind of coordinate it needs to be given
 * to use in the generic typing.
 *
 * Saving of a store is not done automatically, and in fact a store has no concept of persistence on its own.
 * You may find [PokemonStoreFactory] instructive, as the factory is responsible for handling a storage's persistence.
 *
 * <strong>Note:</strong> If you are implementing this and will rely on one of Cobblemon's save solutions
 * such as a [FileBackedPokemonStoreFactory], then you must include a constructor that accepts a single [UUID] parameter.
