     * be used as the intensity of the primary animation. One minus this intensity will be used as the pose animation's
     * intensity. In other words, the pose animation intensity and the primary animation intensity will always sum to
     * 1 and this curve function represents the intensity of the primary animation.
     *
     * The default value for this curve makes the primary animation rapidly transition in, but does not transition out.
     * The different pre-made options are defined in [WaveFunctions].
