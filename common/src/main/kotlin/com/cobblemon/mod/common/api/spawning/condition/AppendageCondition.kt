/**
 * An appendage to [SpawningCondition] that deserializes from the root of a spawning condition
 * and is then stowed in [SpawningCondition.appendages].
 *
 * As an example, you could add an appendage which has a single field called 'weather'. The [fits]
 * implementation would check the [SpawningContext] using your own logic. Inside the JSON, you
 * would specify the 'weather' property as if it was a built-in field inside [SpawningCondition]. During
 * loading, it will deserialize the [SpawningCondition]'s JSON several times targeting the various
 * appendage classes, and then add those appendages to [SpawningCondition.appendages] so that when
 * the [SpawningCondition] is checked, the appendages are used as extra conditions.
 *
 * There are some conditions that must be met by all implementations of this interface. The class must
 * have a default constructor. Ideally, all the properties should be explicitly nullable.
 *
 * To register an appendage, you run [AppendageCondition.registerAppendage] and you can specify the target
 * [SpawningCondition] class that the appendage applies to or be more specific and provide a predicate that
 * takes a deserialized [SpawningCondition] and returns true if your appendage applies to this.
 *
 * The loading logic for this can be found in the [SpawningConditionAdapter].
 *
 * This solution was shamelessly stolen from Ultima Quests: https://cable-mc.com/docs/ultimaquests.pdf#subsection.8.5
