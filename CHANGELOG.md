### Fixes
- Fixed a bug in which adding organic material to the restoration tank via right click was adding the full count of the stack currently in hand - but only taking 1 of the item.
- Fixed a niche issue where some properties of entities were not initialized correctly, causing Pokémon that appeared to be level 1 until you battle them.
- Fixed Fossilized Drake being missing from the Fossils item tag.
- Fixed Gilded Chest block entity not being cleared on block break, creating spooky ghost blocks. Old ones can be fixed by placing something like a furnace where it was, then breaking the furnace.

- Fixed Supplementaries incompatibility.
- Fixed Fossil Compartment crash with Jade / WAILA forks.
- Fixed pasture block PC lookups when the player is offline.

- Fixed Hisuian Decidueye not being Grass/Fighting.
- Fixed both Decidueye forms learning both Triple Arrows and Spirit Shackle.
- Fixed Pineco being unable to evolve into Shulker Forretress.

- Fixed Pidgey's missing walk animation.
- Fixed Cyndaquil's hidden flames clipping if it was swimming.
- Fixed Chimecho and Chingling being unable to spawn near bells. They are meant to!
- Fixed Tyrantrum and Wailord Party Overlay models peeking through the chat box. It was kinda funny though.
- Fixed hitbox sizes for Seedot, Nuzleaf, and Shiftry.
- Fixed Budew and Lechonk sliding if they walked for too long. 
- Fixed Shedinja T-posing in battle. 
- Fixed recoil evolution condition not working, making things like Basculegion unobtainable.
- Fixed issue where poser debug tools didn't work on JSON posers.
- Fixed issue where gilded chests don't close when going far away.
- Fixed issue where the restoration tank's renderer was reading old data, making it appear wrong.
- Fixed issue where the lights on the restoration tank would not animate if it was facing east. Very specific.
- Fixed client crash with the fossil machine when updating block state on a chunk that is unloaded in the client. I don't understand this but the devs are sure that all of those are real words.
- Fixed Restoration Tank crash with Create upon the tank block's destruction.
- Fixed Restoration Tank over consuming items when interacting with Create blocks.
- Fixed addons that add very many moves to a learn-set causing disappearing Pokémon (visually) issues on servers.
- Fixed Hyper Cutter and Big Pecks incorrectly stating that it prevented accuracy from being lowered in battle.
- Fixed missing messages for Rough Skin and Iron Barbs in battle.
- Fixed a bug where sometimes Pokémon sendouts wouldn't create an entity, or the entity would spawn at 0 0 0 which is not a good place for a Pokémon to be. Or any of us, really.
- Fixed issue in which a locked gilded chest would animate to the open state when the client fails to open it, such as when it is locked.
- Fixed a bug where aspects of a form would not be properly reflected on form changes (eg. Normal -> Hisui).
- Fixed generic battle effect sounds not sounding the way they were intended to.
- Fixed particle effects often not having access to some specific entity functions from MoLang.
- Fixed particles sometimes lasting a single tick too long, causing (very quick) visual glitches.
- Fixed particle rotations being inverted. 
- Fixed particle events not spawning at the instigating particle's location.
- Fixed a bunch of spam during world generation.
- Fixed a bug in which throwing a Poké Ball at a player owned Pokémon with the ability Illusion would reveal its true species. Hilarious meta strategy.
- Fixed root-part animations not working for JSON posed Pokémon. You didn't notice this but if we didn't fix this in this update then if you use Quick Attack a lot you'd have seen a whole lot of [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1076993968803434627/1242660506783715369/Minecraft__1.20.1_-_Singleplayer_2024-05-21_22-08-17.mp4?ex=66549408&is=66534288&hm=ff95ee293eb15634fd63e6546534ea279540a1c892605e8d561593ca2c5600c5&) which is damn funny but very unintended.

### Data Pack & Resource Pack Creators
- Added support for MoLang conditions for quirks and poses.

- Added parametric motion and rotation support to particle effects.
- Added entity_scale as a molang var for particles (likely only applicable to Pokemon)
- Added support for primary quirk animations using the following format:
```JSON
{
  "quirks": [

  ]
}
```

### Localization
- Updated translations for:
  - Simplified and Traditional Chinese.
  - Spanish.

## [1.5.0 - The Ruins and Revival Update (May 12th, 2024)](#1-5-0)

- Added the Data Monitor, Fossil Compartment, and Restoration Tank blocks.

- Added simple move animations for Pokémon in battle with a proof of concept (Flamethrower) for more complicated animations. More and more specific animations will come in future updates.

- Added the hidden "True Vivillionaire" advancement.
- Added the [Display Case](https://wiki.cobblemon.com/index.php/Display_Case) block. Use it to display your archaeological findings, Poké Balls, or other items.

- Added Nether Fire Stone Ore to, surprisingly, the Nether.
- Added Terracotta Sun Stone Ore to Badlands biomes.
- Added the EV Boosting Feathers.
- Added [Gilded Chests](https://wiki.cobblemon.com/index.php/Gilded_Chest), available in all Apricorn colors.
- Added Relic Coins, Relic Coin Pouches, and Relic Coin Sacks. Gimmighoul might be interested in these.

- Added Hisui starters to the starter selection menu. They come inside of ancient Poké Balls.
- Added a bubble quirk to Krabby that only plays during clear sunsets. It looks familiar...
- Added forfeit option to PVP battles.

- Added various new tags for search-ability and better mod compatibility.
- Added the [Ability Capsule](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ability_Capsule) and [Patch](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ability_Patch). These have no way of getting them (for now) and only work as intended with the traditional ability format of 1 to 2 common abilities and 1 hidden ability.

- Added all ores to the modloader ore tags, and added tags for each ore type to the mod (both blocks and items).
- Changed the Destiny Knot to be crafted with a Ghast Tear rather than a diamond. We have big plans for the Destiny Knot...
- You can now punch grown apricorns to harvest them. We saw so many content creators breaking apricorns with their fists that it was making us die inside.
- The "Poké Ball" Vivillon variant is now obtainable by evolving a Spewpa after obtaining the "Aspiring Vivillionaire" advancement.
- Renamed the "Vivillionaire" advancement to "Aspiring Vivillionaire"
- Removed the Inferno, Forsaken, Poké Ball, and Void patterns from the Aspiring Vivillionaire advancement.
- Updated the biome tags for Spewpa's evolutions into the various Vivillon patterns. You should mostly be getting one evolution option at a time now.
- Apricorn Sprouts can now be planted directly on Apricorn leaves to create a new Apricorn of the same color.
- Added tooltips to interaction GUIs to make it clearer what they do.
- Poké Ball recipes now use tags for their center ingredient, rather than specifically Copper Ingots, Iron Ingots, Gold Ingots, and Diamonds, allowing for further datapack customisation and mod compatibility.

- Remade Torkoal particles, now they only appear when in battle.
- Improved the shiny icon within summary and PC interfaces.

- Density, Season, and Nether biome tags have been moved and renamed within the biome tags directory.
- Added particles to Lucario when in battle. Lucario is special.
- Movesets updated for Blueberry DLC.

### Fixes
- Re-added the recipe for the Iron vitamin. Well, technically it's a mineral.
- Fixed Exeggcute and Pikachu not being able to evolve.
- Fixed evolution priority for Exeggcute and Pikachu regional evolutions. Using a thunder stone on Kantonian Pikachu on the beach will give Alolan Raichu. A second thunder stone would then give Kantonian Raichu.
- Fixed battle text for the Poison Touch Ability.
- Finally found Sudowoodo and Bonsly. They were missing spawn data. Same with Drifloon and Litwick. Uh... sorry about that.
- Fixed Squawkabilly forms not being recognized.
- Fixed the bounce animation for Poké Balls being delayed by like, a full second. It's enough to drive you mad.
- Note blocks now play the correct sound on the Apricorn Plank-based blocks.
- Fixed an issue with transformed parts in posers causing whacky positional issues.
- Fixed Poké Balls freezing in an open state if you're looking away at the moment that it's meant to close. This actually fixes some other things but it's hard to explain.
- Fixed thrown Poké Balls technically having no name.
- Fixed very many issues with Bedrock particle effects. There are probably many more. Life goes on.
- Fixed Arbok patterns not being as specific in spawning as they were intended to be.
- Fixed Pokémon not avoiding danger at all when pathfinding. 
- Fixed Pokémon pathing over snow layers and carpets.
- Fixed the Sobble line not being able to swim or breathe underwater.
- Fixed mod incompatibility with [Just Enough Resources](https://modrinth.com/mod/just-enough-resources-jer).
- Fixed mod incompatibility with [Visual Overhaul](https://modrinth.com/mod/visual-overhaul).
- Fixed an issue that allowed Pokémon to spawn on rails.
- Fixed the data set on Pokémon when abilities are given via properties such as in ``/spawnpokemon``.
- Fixed Pokémon sometimes losing hidden abilities when evolving. This fix will only take effect for newly created Pokémon because of technical reasons that were explained to me but which I then forgot.
- Fixed capture messages not displaying in battle.
- Fixed the Illusion ability causing the wrong Pokémon to be targeted in battle. 
- Fixed battles started with fainted party members causing a soft-lock on defeat.
- Fixed some issues with eyes in the faint animations of Hitmonlee and Phantump
- Fixed missing evolution moves, for example Stone Axe for Kleavor.
- Cleaned up empty evolutions declaration in species data (And no, I'm not listing all 169. No I don't care what you pay me, I'm not doing it).
- Fixed non-consumable held items being consumed or swapped in battle permanently.

### Developer
- Significantly changed the way the properties in PokemonEntity work. This could break some plugins (not in a big way, but changes will be needed for some things).
- Rebuilt the scheduling API to more clearly force side choices and temporal frames of reference for tasks. The developers say that how it works is cool but I stopped listening.
- Added dialogue API and data registry. This is powerful, and there is a full example in the Cobblemon mod you can trigger using /opendialogue \<username\> cobblemon:example. The example JSON is inside the data folder of the mod.
- Opened up the ItemDropEntry class to allow for it to be extended.
- Added a new "advancement" evolution variant that takes an advancement identifier and succeeds if the player has the advancement.
- Made the spawning API capable of non-entity spawning. You can make it 'spawn' commands if you want. Go nuts.
- Made PokemonProperties.parse more interoperable with Java. Save yourself and stop using Java.
- Added the ``HeldItemEvent``, this comes with 2 implementation ``HeldItemEvent.Pre`` and ``HeldItemEvent.Post``. 
- Corrections to the ability implementation have been made that make ``Ability.forced`` function as intended and never reroll an ability for a Pokémon, please check your implementations to ensure the corrected behavior is intended for your use case.
- ``Pokemon.ability`` no longer has a public setter. Please migrate to using ``Pokemon#updateAbility``, this handles the ability coordinate storage for you when necessary.
- ``Ability.forced``, ``Ability.index`` and ``Ability.priority`` have all had their setters internalized, there is no longer any need to manually adjust these migrate to the method mentioned above to handle that process for you.
- ``AbilityChanger`` has been added to API alongside some implementations, this is subject to change as the ability capsule and patch currently only expect the traditional behaviour in the Pokémon games of 1 or 2 regular abilities and 1 hidden ability.
- ``Pokemon#rollAbility`` has been added which rerolls for a legal ability for the Pokémon.
- `docs/cobblemon-tags` tags and spawn-presets can now be auto-generated from the current tags in the Cobblemon mod with the `generateSpawnPresetList.py` and `generateTagList.py` scripts.
- `public_spawns_to_json.py` script has been added to give the powerful spawn.json generator a simplistic UI.
- Updated Showdown with Gen 9 DLC.
- Changed mixins to be Java 17 for compatibility level instead of 16, removing a warning from startup logs.

### Datapack & Resourcepack Creators
- The maximum amount of fossils that can fit in the Fossil Analyzer can be adjusted in the config.
- Custom fossils can be defined using a list of items and the resulting Pokémon. An example of `aerodactyl.json`:
```JSON
{
  "result": "aerodactyl",
  "fossils": [
    "cobblemon:old_amber_fossil"
  ]
}
```
- Fetus models can be defined in `bedrock/fossils`.
- Fetus textures can be defined in `textures/fossils`.
- Fuel for the Restoration Machine is registered inside the `natural_materials` folder. To register more fuels, create a JSON file containing an array of objects. Each object supports the following fields:
  - `content`: Integer containing the amount of fuel to add.
  - `item` OR `tag`: Identifier of the item or item tag to be inserted.
  - `returnItem`: Identifier of an item to return to the player after consumption.
- Added 3 new item tags: `ancient_poke_balls`, `fossils`, and `tumblestones`.
- Added a spawn rules system to modify general spawning behaviour, see the [wiki](https://wiki.cobblemon.com/index.php/Spawn_Rules) for more information.
- Added dialogue datapack folder and /opendialogue command.
- Added the item tag ``cobblemon:held/leaves_leftovers`` this can be used to flag apple-like items that can create leftovers when eaten.
- You can now add support for dynamic lighting implementations, Cobblemon ships with a default implementation for [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights) and the [Dynamic Lights Reforged](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamiclights-reforged), add the following to any species or form:
```JSON
{
  "lightingData": {
    "lightLevel": 14,
    "_lightLevelCommentRemoveMe": "Above supports 0 to 15",
    "liquidGlowMode": "LAND",
    "_liquidGlowModeCommentRemoveMe": "Above supports LAND, UNDERWATER or BOTH"
  }
}
```
- Following up on this change ``light_source`` was removed as a possible shoulder effect due to becoming unnecessary and never having had a default implementation.
- Added the item tag ``cobblemon:ability_changers``, contains the ``cobblemon:ability_capsule`` & ``cobblemon:ability_patch`` by default.
- Added the item tag ``cobblemon:held/is_friendship_booster``, allows items to give the Soothe Bell effect of a boost of 1.5x Friendship gained, contains ``cobblemon:soothe_bell`` by default.

### Developer
- Added SpawnEvent, ThrownPokeballHitEvent, PokemonSentEvent, PokemonRecalledEvent.
- Added BattleFledEvent, BattleStartedEvent, BattleFaintedEvent.
- Added persistent NBT property inside Pokémon to store quick and simple data.
- Species and FormData have had their evolutions, pre-evolution and labels properties exposed. It is still recommended to work using a Pokémon instance when possible.
- Added capture check to BattleVictoryEvent.
- The various hardcoded potion shoulder effects have been removed, make use of PotionBaseEffect.
- Added ContextManager for tracking causes and contexts of conditions created during a battle. See BattleContext for types of conditions that are tracked. 
- Added MongoDB support for storing Pokémon and Player data. Must be enabled in config, requires MongoDB core and sync drivers (4.10.0+).
- CobblemonShowdown updated to version 10.
- Generation of a battle can be set in BattleFormat.
- Pokémon now have ``teraType``, ``dmaxLevel``, and ``gmaxFactor`` properties. Gimmicks can be used during battle by adding the respective identifiers to ``keyItems`` in PlayerData: ``key_stone``, ``z_ring``, ``dynamax_band``, and ``tera_orb``. Dynamax is only supported in Gen 8 battles. Mega Evolution and Z-Power require custom held items to be added (e.g. an item with the path ``gengarite`` will allow Gengar to Mega Evolve). Currently custom Z-Crystals and Mega Stones are not supported.

### Datapack & Resourcepack Creators
- All potion related shoulder effects have had their IDs changed. They now all share the same type being `potion_effect` and use the vanilla Potion data [parameters](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Potion#Item_data). For example, here is the converted Pidgey asset:
  - ```json
    {
      "type": "potion_effect",
      "effect": "minecraft:slow_falling",
      "amplifier": 0,
      "ambient": true,
      "showParticles": false,
      "showIcon": false
    }
    ```
- Renamed the ``walked_steps`` evolution requirement to ``blocks_traveled``.
- Added support for scale in animations.
- Added support for jump keyframes (i.e. pre and post keyframes)
- Added structure spawning conditions
- Added Advancement trigger for defeating Pokémon and collecting varieties of Pokémon.
- Added support for "isBattle" and "isTouchingWater" properties on resource pack Pokémon poses. This allows your custom Pokémon to be posed differently when in battle.
- Added support for "isVisible" on a transformed part on resource pack Pokémon poses. This allows your custom Pokémon to have bones disappear in specific poses, such as hiding Greninja's throwing star when not in a battle pose.
- Added support for battle music. Sounds can be added to the ``battle.pvp.default`` and ``battle.pvw.default`` sound events.
- Added 'enabled' optional property on model layers, allowing later variations to disable previously-defined layers. See [this issue](https://gitlab.com/cable-mc/cobblemon/-/issues/335) for how this looks.
- Cobblemon items can now all have their own tooltips via resourcepacks. To add a tooltip, add a lang entry like "item.cobblemon.{item_id}.tooltip". If you want to add multiple tooltip lines you can do so with "item.cobblemon.{item_id}.tooltip_1" and upwards.
- Item interaction evolutions and held item requirements now support NBT by creating an object JSON containing the key ``item`` for what used to be the existing condition support and a ``nbt`` key for the NBT format, this is the string [format](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/NBT_format) expected in commands. Existing data does not need to be updated.
- Fixed faint animations not working properly in add-ons.
- Fixed non-existent species in spawn pool files causing random species to spawn.

### Localization
- Added partial translations for Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Hungarian, Czech, Cyprus Greek, and even Esperanto.

- Added the `/spawnpokemonfrompool [amount]` or `/forcespawn [amount]` command to spawn Pokémon(s) in the surrounding area using the natural spawn rates/pool of that area, this will be a cheat command in the Minecraft permission system or use the permission `cobblemon.command.spawnpokemon` if a permission mod is present. On a successful execution of the command, the amount of Pokémon spawned will be the output.
- Added the `/pokebox` and `/pokeboxall` commands to move Pokémon(s) to the PC from a Player's party, this will be a cheat command in the Minecraft permission system or use the permission `cobblemon.command.pokebox` if a permission mod is present. On a successful execution of the command the output will be the number of pokemon moved to the Player's PC.
- Added the `/pc` command which opens up the PC UI the same way interacting with the block would, this will be a cheat command in the Minecraft permission system or use the permission `cobblemon.command.pc` if a permission mod is present.

### Changes
- You can now click the portraits of other Pokémon in the starter selection screen to navigate directly to them.
- You can now click the right and left arrow keys to navigate PC boxes.
- Link Cables will now require Pokémon to hold any held item normally required for their evolution.
- After a battle, the last Pokémon used now becomes the selected one in your party.
- The `/teach` command can now only allow the Pokémon to be given moves in their learnset, this can be controlled with the permission `cobblemon.command.teach.bypass`, to account for that change the base command now requires the permission `cobblemon.command.teach.base`, this change is meant only for people using a mod capable of providing permissions such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).

- Lowered spawn rate of Gyarados on the surface of water.

- Updated Swinub line model and animations.
- Tweaked portrait frames for the Pidgey line and for Walking Wake.
- Changed all buff shoulder effects to only give a level 1 buff instead of level 2.
- Made Weavile a little bigger.
- Changed the recipes for Mystic Water, Miracle Seed, and Charcoal Stick to utilise the evolution stones, as well as Never-Melt Ice having an alternate recipe using the Ice Stone.
- Replaced the `Failed to handle` battle messages to `Missing interpretation` to make it more clear that mechanics do work just still pending dedicated messages.
- Healing Machine and PC are now mine-able with pickaxes and Apricorn leaves are mine-able using hoes.

### Fixes

- Fixed shiny Zubat, Grimer, Omanyte, Elgyem, Delphox and Aegislash displaying their normal texture.
- Fixed sleeping in beds allowing fainted Pokémon to receive experience after a battle ends somehow.
- Fixed an issue where a Pokémon will claim to have learnt a new move they already have in their moveset when learnt at an earlier level in their previous evolution. I realize that's confusing.

- Updated models and textures for Tentacool line, Gengar, Slowpoke line, Tyrogue line, Doduo line, Dratini, Dragonair, Quagsire, and Piplup line. There were probably others, the team lost track.
- Improved sending out Pokémon at the start of battle so that they are positioned in a less annoying way.
