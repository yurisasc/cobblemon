  - `returnItem`: Identifier of an item to return to the player after consumption.

- Fixed players being able to trade, battle and let out their Pokémon while in spectator mode.
- Fixed Galarian Yamask not being able to evolve and by proxy the ``damage_taken`` evolution requirement.
- Fixed Bisharp not being able to evolve and by proxy the ``defeat`` evolution requirement.
- Fixed White-Striped Basculin not being able to evolve because of a broken ``recoil`` evolution requirement.
- Fixed Primeape, Qwilfish and Stantler not being able to evolve because of a broken ``use_move`` evolution requirement.

### Developer
- Added SpawnEvent, ThrownPokeballHitEvent, PokemonSentEvent, PokemonRecalledEvent.
- Added BattleFledEvent, BattleStartedEvent, BattleFaintedEvent.
- Added persistent NBT property inside Pokémon to store quick and simple data.
- Species and FormData have had their evolutions, pre-evolution and labels properties exposed. It is still recommended to work using a Pokémon instance when possible.
- Added capture check to BattleVictoryEvent.
- The various hardcoded potion shoulder effects have been removed, make use of PotionBaseEffect.
- Added ContextManager for tracking causes and contexts of conditions created during a battle. See BattleContext for types of conditions that are tracked. 
- Added MongoDB support for storing Pokémon and Player data. Must be enabled in config, requires MongoDB core and sync drivers (4.10.0+).
- CobblemonShowdown updated to version 10.
- Generation of a battle can be set in BattleFormat.
- Pokémon now have ``teraType``, ``dmaxLevel``, and ``gmaxFactor`` properties. Gimmicks can be used during battle by adding the respective identifiers to ``keyItems`` in PlayerData: ``key_stone``, ``z_ring``, ``dynamax_band``, and ``tera_orb``. Dynamax is only supported in Gen 8 battles. Mega Evolution and Z-Power require custom held items to be added (e.g. an item with the path ``gengarite`` will allow Gengar to Mega Evolve). Currently custom Z-Crystals and Mega Stones are not supported.

### Datapack & Resourcepack Creators
- All potion related shoulder effects have had their IDs changed. They now all share the same type being `potion_effect` and use the vanilla Potion data [parameters](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Potion#Item_data). For example, here is the converted Pidgey asset:
  - ```json
    {
      "type": "potion_effect",
      "effect": "minecraft:slow_falling",
      "amplifier": 0,
      "ambient": true,
      "showParticles": false,
      "showIcon": false
    }
    ```
- Renamed the ``walked_steps`` evolution requirement to ``blocks_traveled``.
- Added support for scale in animations.
- Added support for jump keyframes (i.e. pre and post keyframes)
- Added structure spawning conditions
- Added Advancement trigger for defeating Pokémon and collecting varieties of Pokémon.
- Added support for "isBattle" and "isTouchingWater" properties on resource pack Pokémon poses. This allows your custom Pokémon to be posed differently when in battle.
- Added support for "isVisible" on a transformed part on resource pack Pokémon poses. This allows your custom Pokémon to have bones disappear in specific poses, such as hiding Greninja's throwing star when not in a battle pose.
- Added support for battle music. Sounds can be added to the ``battle.pvp.default`` and ``battle.pvw.default`` sound events.
- Added 'enabled' optional property on model layers, allowing later variations to disable previously-defined layers. See [this issue](https://gitlab.com/cable-mc/cobblemon/-/issues/335) for how this looks.
- Cobblemon items can now all have their own tooltips via resourcepacks. To add a tooltip, add a lang entry like "item.cobblemon.{item_id}.tooltip". If you want to add multiple tooltip lines you can do so with "item.cobblemon.{item_id}.tooltip_1" and upwards.
- Item interaction evolutions and held item requirements now support NBT by creating an object JSON containing the key ``item`` for what used to be the existing condition support and a ``nbt`` key for the NBT format, this is the string [format](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/NBT_format) expected in commands. Existing data does not need to be updated.
- Fixed faint animations not working properly in add-ons.
- Fixed non-existent species in spawn pool files causing random species to spawn.

### Localization
- Added partial translations for Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Hungarian, Czech, Cyprus Greek, and even Esperanto.
- Updated translation for French and Canadian French, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish and Mexican Spanish, Pirate English, German, Thai, Turkish, Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese, Ukrainian, and Russian.

## [1.3.1 (March 31st, 2023)](#1-3-1)

- Added animations to Staryu line and Porygon line.
- Added faint animations to Klink line.
- Add lava surface spawn preset.
- Added an ``any`` evolution requirement allowing you to define ``possibilities`` of other evolution requirements, for example, this allows you to create an evolution that requires the Pokémon to be shiny or a female.
- Added the `/spawnpokemonfrompool [amount]` or `/forcespawn [amount]` command to spawn Pokémon(s) in the surrounding area using the natural spawn rates/pool of that area, this will be a cheat command in the Minecraft permission system or use the permission `cobblemon.command.spawnpokemon` if a permission mod is present. On a successful execution of the command, the amount of Pokémon spawned will be the output.
- Added the `/pokebox` and `/pokeboxall` commands to move Pokémon(s) to the PC from a Player's party, this will be a cheat command in the Minecraft permission system or use the permission `cobblemon.command.pokebox` if a permission mod is present. On a successful execution of the command the output will be the number of pokemon moved to the Player's PC.
- Added the `/pc` command which opens up the PC UI the same way interacting with the block would, this will be a cheat command in the Minecraft permission system or use the permission `cobblemon.command.pc` if a permission mod is present.

- After a battle, the last Pokémon used now becomes the selected one in your party.
- The `/teach` command can now only allow the Pokémon to be given moves in their learnset, this can be controlled with the permission `cobblemon.command.teach.bypass`, to account for that change the base command now requires the permission `cobblemon.command.teach.base`, this change is meant only for people using a mod capable of providing permissions such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).
- Apricorns will no longer collide with their block form when picked, this should improve the experience in automatic farms.

- Tweaked portrait frames for the Pidgey line and for Walking Wake.
- Changed all buff shoulder effects to only give a level 1 buff instead of level 2.

- Changed the recipes for Mystic Water, Miracle Seed, and Charcoal Stick to utilise the evolution stones, as well as Never-Melt Ice having an alternate recipe using the Ice Stone.
- Replaced the `Failed to handle` battle messages to `Missing interpretation` to make it more clear that mechanics do work just still pending dedicated messages.
- Healing Machine and PC are now mine-able with pickaxes and Apricorn leaves are mine-able using hoes.

### Fixes

- Fixed sleeping in beds allowing fainted Pokémon to receive experience after a battle ends somehow.
- Fixed an issue where a Pokémon will claim to have learnt a new move they already have in their moveset when learnt at an earlier level in their previous evolution. I realize that's confusing.

- Apricorns are now compatible with any mod that breaks a whole tree at once.
- Apricorns no longer have a config value for the seed drop chance these are now a part of their loot table which can be found in ``cobblemon/loot_tables/blocks/<color>_apricorn.json``.

- Updated models and textures for Tentacool line, Gengar, Slowpoke line, Tyrogue line, Doduo line, Dratini, Dragonair, Quagsire, and Piplup line. There were probably others, the team lost track.

- Added Alolan Rattata and Alolan Raticate, Sableye, Deerling and Sawsbuck, and Pyukumukurutudulu or whatever it's called.
- Added swimming AI so Pokémon don't sink to the bottom in water.
- Aquatic Pokémon like Magikarp desperately move to water if they're on land.
- Added status condition indicators in the party overlay.
- Added HP labels to the battle interface so that you can see how much health you actually have.
- Added spawn data for all final and special evolutions previously lacking spawn data.
- Added shiny textures for many Pokémon (thank you MageFX!): Aerodactyl, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Chansey, the Dratini family, Electabuzz, Goldeen and Seaking, Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee, Jynx, Kabuto and Kabutops, Magmar, Lickitung, Mr. Mime, Omanyte and Omastar, Rhyhorn and Rhydon, Koffing and Weezing, Porygon, Scyther, Seadra, Staryu and Starmie, and Tangela. Phew!
- Added a couple of new advancements.
- Added new items: Calcium, Carbos, HP Up, Iron, Protein, and Zinc. Currently only obtainable in Creative Mode (It's a surprise tool that will help us later).

### Changes
- Significantly improved AI pathing for larger entities so they won't keep trying to move to places they cannot possibly fit.
- Changed the starter menu and summary menu keybinds to `M` by default.
- Pokémon that are sent out slowly raise friendship. Before this it was faster and even worked when not sent out (wildly unbalanced).
- Updated Link Cable and Protector item sprites to be prettier.
- Slightly polished the Poké Ball opening and Poké Ball item use sounds.
- `/givepokemon random`, `/spawnpokemon random`, and `/spawnallpokemon` will now only choose implemented Pokémon.
- The battle message box now displays even when the battle GUI is minimised so that you can still see what's going on.
- Moved the `R` prompt in battle to be higher on the screen so that it's not as distracting.

### Fixes
- Fixed shinies and form variations not displaying in the party or PC.
- Fixed servers getting stuck on shutdown due to non-closed showdown server connections.
- Fixed a niche situation where players could challenge themselves. It's a little inspirational if you think about it.
- Fixed Pokémon natures not saving such that every time you restarted they had a totally different nature.
- Fixed some underground Pokémon spawning above ground instead. I'm told other weird spawns were probably fixed at the same time.
- Fixed Pokémon sometimes running in place. "It's still possible, but much less likely" - Yeah, ok devs.
- Fixed mod incompatibility with many Architectury API mods, including *Biome Makeover* and *Earth2Java*.
- Fixed a mod incompatibility with Minecraft Transit Railway Fabric and probably a bunch of other Fabric mods.
- Fixed being unable to customize keybinds on Forge.
- Fixed Summary keybinding being labeled as PokéNav. That comes later.
- Fixed apricorns spawning without leaves which meant sometimes apricorns were growing on the side of dirt and stone which doesn't make much sense to me.
- Fixed messages appearing in the console whenever a healer is used.
- Fixed spawning in several biome tag categories.
- Fixed resource pack support for Pokémon models and textures.
- **Model Fixes**
  - Fixed Paras and Nidoqueen looking very weird.
  - Fixed Hitmonchan asserting dominance with a T-pose as well as Grimer and Muk pointing their hands to the sky.
  - Fixed specific Pokémon suddenly pausing their animation after staying still for a long time.
  - Fixed Mankey's feet being buried in the ground.
  - Updated the Substitute model and updated its shiny texture to be better for the red-green colorblind.
  - Improved Horsea, Seadra, and Kingdra animations, especially on land.
- **Battle Fixes**
  - Fixed an issue with battles where Pokémon had a different max HP causing some desync issues with the health bars.
  - Fixed Magnitude battle messages.
  - Moves that are disabled or out of PP now show transparently in the battle GUI instead of being hidden completely.
  - Statuses like sleep and frozen no longer last forever if it was carried over from a previous battle.

### Localization
- Added species, ability, and move translations for `ko_ko`, `jp_jp`, `fr_fr`, `es_es`, `it_it`, and `zh_cn`.

## [1.0.0 (November 12th, 2022)](#1-0-0)
