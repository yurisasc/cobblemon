### Developer
- Added SpawnEvent, ThrownPokeballHitEvent, PokemonSentEvent, PokemonRecalledEvent.
- Added BattleFledEvent, BattleStartedEvent, BattleFaintedEvent.
- Added persistent NBT property inside Pokémon to store quick and simple data.
- Species and FormData have had their evolutions, pre-evolution and labels properties exposed. It is still recommended to work using a Pokémon instance when possible.
- Added capture check to BattleVictoryEvent.
- The various hardcoded potion shoulder effects have been removed, make use of PotionBaseEffect.
- Added ContextManager for tracking causes and contexts of conditions created during a battle. See BattleContext for types of conditions that are tracked. 
- Added MongoDB support for storing Pokémon and Player data. Must be enabled in config, requires MongoDB core and sync drivers (4.10.0+).
- CobblemonShowdown updated to version 10.
- Generation of a battle can be set in BattleFormat.
- Pokémon now have ``teraType``, ``dmaxLevel``, and ``gmaxFactor`` properties. Gimmicks can be used during battle by adding the respective identifiers to ``keyItems`` in PlayerData: ``key_stone``, ``z_ring``, ``dynamax_band``, and ``tera_orb``. Dynamax is only supported in Gen 8 battles. Mega Evolution and Z-Power require custom held items to be added (e.g. an item with the path ``gengarite`` will allow Gengar to Mega Evolve). Currently custom Z-Crystals and Mega Stones are not supported.

### Datapack & Resourcepack Creators
- All potion related shoulder effects have had their IDs changed. They now all share the same type being `potion_effect` and use the vanilla Potion data [parameters](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Potion#Item_data). For example, here is the converted Pidgey asset:
  - ```json
    {
      "type": "potion_effect",
      "effect": "minecraft:slow_falling",
      "amplifier": 0,
      "ambient": true,
      "showParticles": false,
      "showIcon": false
    }
    ```
- Renamed the ``walked_steps`` evolution requirement to ``blocks_traveled``.
- Added support for scale in animations.
- Added support for jump keyframes (i.e. pre and post keyframes)
- Added structure spawning conditions
- Added Advancement trigger for defeating Pokémon and collecting varieties of Pokémon.
- Added support for "isBattle" and "isTouchingWater" properties on resource pack Pokémon poses. This allows your custom Pokémon to be posed differently when in battle.
- Added support for "isVisible" on a transformed part on resource pack Pokémon poses. This allows your custom Pokémon to have bones disappear in specific poses, such as hiding Greninja's throwing star when not in a battle pose.
- Added support for battle music. Sounds can be added to the ``battle.pvp.default`` and ``battle.pvw.default`` sound events.
- Added 'enabled' optional property on model layers, allowing later variations to disable previously-defined layers. See [this issue](https://gitlab.com/cable-mc/cobblemon/-/issues/335) for how this looks.
- Cobblemon items can now all have their own tooltips via resourcepacks. To add a tooltip, add a lang entry like "item.cobblemon.{item_id}.tooltip". If you want to add multiple tooltip lines you can do so with "item.cobblemon.{item_id}.tooltip_1" and upwards.
- Item interaction evolutions and held item requirements now support NBT by creating an object JSON containing the key ``item`` for what used to be the existing condition support and a ``nbt`` key for the NBT format, this is the string [format](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/NBT_format) expected in commands. Existing data does not need to be updated.
- Fixed faint animations not working properly in add-ons.
- Fixed non-existent species in spawn pool files causing random species to spawn.

### Localization

- Added animations to Staryu line and Porygon line.
- Added faint animations to Klink line.
- Add lava surface spawn preset.
- Added an ``any`` evolution requirement allowing you to define ``possibilities`` of other evolution requirements, for example, this allows you to create an evolution that requires the Pokémon to be shiny or a female.
- Added the `/spawnpokemonfrompool [amount]` or `/forcespawn [amount]` command to spawn Pokémon(s) in the surrounding area using the natural spawn rates/pool of that area, this will be a cheat command in the Minecraft permission system or use the permission `cobblemon.command.spawnpokemon` if a permission mod is present. On a successful execution of the command, the amount of Pokémon spawned will be the output.
- Added the `/pokebox` and `/pokeboxall` commands to move Pokémon(s) to the PC from a Player's party, this will be a cheat command in the Minecraft permission system or use the permission `cobblemon.command.pokebox` if a permission mod is present. On a successful execution of the command the output will be the number of pokemon moved to the Player's PC.
- Added the `/pc` command which opens up the PC UI the same way interacting with the block would, this will be a cheat command in the Minecraft permission system or use the permission `cobblemon.command.pc` if a permission mod is present.

### Changes
- You can now click the portraits of other Pokémon in the starter selection screen to navigate directly to them.
- You can now click the right and left arrow keys to navigate PC boxes.
- Link Cables will now require Pokémon to hold any held item normally required for their evolution.
- After a battle, the last Pokémon used now becomes the selected one in your party.
- The `/teach` command can now only allow the Pokémon to be given moves in their learnset, this can be controlled with the permission `cobblemon.command.teach.bypass`, to account for that change the base command now requires the permission `cobblemon.command.teach.base`, this change is meant only for people using a mod capable of providing permissions such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).
- Apricorns will no longer collide with their block form when picked, this should improve the experience in automatic farms.

- Lowered spawn rate of Gyarados on the surface of water.

- Updated Swinub line model and animations.
- Tweaked portrait frames for the Pidgey line and for Walking Wake.
- Changed all buff shoulder effects to only give a level 1 buff instead of level 2.
- Made Weavile a little bigger.
- Changed the recipes for Mystic Water, Miracle Seed, and Charcoal Stick to utilise the evolution stones, as well as Never-Melt Ice having an alternate recipe using the Ice Stone.
- Replaced the `Failed to handle` battle messages to `Missing interpretation` to make it more clear that mechanics do work just still pending dedicated messages.
- Healing Machine and PC are now mine-able with pickaxes and Apricorn leaves are mine-able using hoes.

### Fixes

- Fixed sleeping in beds allowing fainted Pokémon to receive experience after a battle ends somehow.
- Fixed an issue where a Pokémon will claim to have learnt a new move they already have in their moveset when learnt at an earlier level in their previous evolution. I realize that's confusing.

- Fixed a bug that caused already interpreted messages for moves to be mistaken as uninterpreted.
- Fixed a Pokémon spawner bug that caused Pokémon to not spawn due to dropped item entities.

- Apricorns are now compatible with any mod that breaks a whole tree at once.
- Apricorns no longer have a config value for the seed drop chance these are now a part of their loot table which can be found in ``cobblemon/loot_tables/blocks/<color>_apricorn.json``.

- Updated models and textures for Tentacool line, Gengar, Slowpoke line, Tyrogue line, Doduo line, Dratini, Dragonair, Quagsire, and Piplup line. There were probably others, the team lost track.
- Improved sending out Pokémon at the start of battle so that they are positioned in a less annoying way.
- Name Tags will no longer be used on Pokémon and Poke Ball entities, this prevents the item from being wasted.

#### "Ideally not at the same time."

- Added a new GUI for viewing party information, rearranging moves, and evolving Pokémon. It looks too good.
- Starter Pokémon will sleep on top of you if sent out when you get on a bed.

- Fixed spawning in several biome tag categories.
