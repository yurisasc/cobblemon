- Apricorns are now compatible with any mod that breaks a whole tree at once.
- Apricorns no longer have a config value for the seed drop chance these are now a part of their loot table which can be found in ``cobblemon/loot_tables/blocks/<color>_apricorn.json``.

## [1.1.0 - The Swim and Sleep Update (November 27th, 2022)](#1-1-0)
#### "Ideally not at the same time."
### Additions
- Added a new GUI for viewing party information, rearranging moves, and evolving Pokémon. It looks too good.
- Starter Pokémon will sleep on top of you if sent out when you get on a bed.

Phew!
- Added a couple of new advancements.
- Added new items: Calcium, Carbos, HP Up, Iron, Protein, and Zinc. Currently only obtainable in Creative Mode (It's a surprise tool that will help us later).

### Changes
- Significantly improved AI pathing for larger entities so they won't keep trying to move to places they cannot possibly fit.
- Changed the starter menu and summary menu keybinds to `M` by default.
- Pokémon that are sent out slowly raise friendship. Before this it was faster and even worked when not sent out (wildly unbalanced).

### Fixes
- Fixed shinies and form variations not displaying in the party or PC.

- Fixed a mod incompatibility with Minecraft Transit Railway Fabric and probably a bunch of other Fabric mods.
- Fixed being unable to customize keybinds on Forge.
- Fixed Summary keybinding being labeled as PokéNav. That comes later.
- Fixed apricorns spawning without leaves which meant sometimes apricorns were growing on the side of dirt and stone which doesn't make much sense to me.
- Fixed messages appearing in the console whenever a healer is used.
- Fixed spawning in several biome tag categories.
- Fixed resource pack support for Pokémon models and textures.
- **Model Fixes**
