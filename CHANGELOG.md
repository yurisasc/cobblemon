# Changelog

## [1.2.1](#1-2-1)
### Additions
- Added `/giveallpokemon` command which is definitely safe and not insane.
- Added generation 9 Pokémon species, move and ability data.
- Added a cap of Pokémon spawns in an area because waiting a while made things insane. Controlled by a new `pokemonPerChunk` config option.
- Pokémon now save to the world by default, meaning the same Pokémon will remain in the world and not disappear after you log out and log back in.
- [Dispensers](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dispenser) can now use shears to automatically harvest fully grown Apricorns.
- Apricorn seeds can now be used with the [Composter](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Composter), these have the layer increase chance of 65% like Apricorns and various Minecraft crops.

- Added a few held items that are currently obtainable in Creative Mode.
- Added the Item [tags](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tag) `cobblemon:held/experience_share` and `cobblemon:held/lucky_egg` allowing you to mark any items you desire to have the effects implied in the tag name.

## [1.1.1 (November 27th, 2022)](#1-1-1)
### Fixes
- Fixed a critical issue with servers where Pokémon data didn't properly synchronize and so you couldn't see any.

## [1.1.0 - The Swim and Sleep Update (November 27th, 2022)](#1-1-0)
#### "Ideally not at the same time."
### Additions
- Added a new GUI for viewing party information, rearranging moves, and evolving Pokémon. It looks too good.
- Starter Pokémon will sleep on top of you if sent out when you get on a bed.
- Added sleeping animations for starters, the Weedle family, and the Caterpie family. More to come.
- Added Alolan Rattata and Alolan Raticate, Sableye, Deerling and Sawsbuck, and Pyukumukurutudulu or whatever it's called.

- Added HP labels to the battle interface so that you can see how much health you actually have.
- Added spawn data for all final and special evolutions previously lacking spawn data.
- Added shiny textures for many Pokémon (thank you MageFX!): Aerodactyl, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Chansey, the Dratini family, Electabuzz, Goldeen and Seaking, Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee, Jynx, Kabuto and Kabutops, Magmar, Lickitung, Mr. Mime, Omanyte and Omastar, Rhyhorn and Rhydon, Koffing and Weezing, Porygon, Scyther, Seadra, Staryu and Starmie, and Tangela. Phew!
- Added a couple of new advancements.
- Added new items: Calcium, Carbos, HP Up, Iron, Protein, and Zinc. Currently only obtainable in Creative Mode (It's a surprise tool that will help us later).

### Changes
- Significantly improved AI pathing for larger entities so they won't keep trying to move to places they cannot possibly fit.
- Changed the starter menu and summary menu keybinds to `M` by default.
- Pokémon that are sent out slowly raise friendship. Before this it was faster and even worked when not sent out (wildly unbalanced).
- Updated Link Cable and Protector item sprites to be prettier.
- Slightly polished the Poké Ball opening and Poké Ball item use sounds.
- `/givepokemon random`, `/spawnpokemon random`, and `/spawnallpokemon` will now only choose implemented Pokémon.
- The battle message box now displays even when the battle GUI is minimised so that you can still see what's going on.

### Fixes
- Fixed shinies and form variations not displaying in the party or PC.
- Fixed servers getting stuck on shutdown due to non-closed showdown server connections.
- Fixed a niche situation where players could challenge themselves. It's a little inspirational if you think about it.
- Fixed Pokémon natures not saving such that every time you restarted they had a totally different nature.
- Fixed some underground Pokémon spawning above ground instead. I'm told other weird spawns were probably fixed at the same time.
- Fixed Pokémon sometimes running in place. "It's still possible, but much less likely" - Yeah, ok devs.
- Fixed mod incompatibility with many Architectury API mods, including *Biome Makeover* and *Earth2Java*.
- Fixed a mod incompatibility with Minecraft Transit Railway Fabric and probably a bunch of other Fabric mods.
- Fixed being unable to customize keybinds on Forge.
- Fixed Summary keybinding being labeled as PokéNav. That comes later.
- Fixed apricorns spawning without leaves which meant sometimes apricorns were growing on the side of dirt and stone which doesn't make much sense to me.
- Fixed messages appearing in the console whenever a healer is used.
- Fixed spawning in several biome tag categories.
- Fixed resource pack support for Pokémon models and textures.
- **Model Fixes**

    - Fixed Mankey's feet being buried in the ground.
    - Updated the Substitute model and updated its shiny texture to be better for the red-green colorblind.
    - Improved Horsea, Seadra, and Kingdra animations, especially on land.
- **Battle Fixes**
    - Fixed an issue with battles where Pokémon had a different max HP causing some desync issues with the health bars.
    - Fixed Magnitude battle messages.
    - Moves that are disabled or out of PP now show transparently in the battle GUI instead of being hidden completely.
